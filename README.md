# Assignments for Master AI Engineering & Game Development

Programs and scripts written for assignments during my 2nd master at FH Technikum Wien

## Convex Hull
A program to determine the [Convex Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) (the smallest convex set of points that contains a shape) using the [Gift Wrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm) and [QuickHull](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickHull) algorithms in Python 3.

## Assignments in Machine Learning 
The assignments in this class were teaching us how some of the most used/known algorithms are realized by implementing them ourselves.   
The programming language of choice was Python 3 with the libraries pandas, numpy, matoplotlib and sklearn. 

* **01 Basic Terminology**: Describe a dataset using the terminology Targets, Features, Test Data, Prediction, etc. 
* **02 K-nearest Neighbors**: Implement the KNN algorithm from scratch 
* **03 Data Handling**: An excel sheet was provided that needed a lot of data cleaning, missing values, wrong formats, etc. This exercise was meant to teach the importance of working carefully and appreciating well structured data. 
* **04 Classification tree**: Implement the simplest version of a classification tree (stump) from scratch by calculating the Gini Index. 
* **05 Linear Regression**: Use linear regression on a dataset and calculate MSE (mean squared error) and r squared from scratch. 
* **06 K-Means**: Implement k-means where the number of clusters (k) and maximum iterations should be parameters.
* **07 Artificial neural networks**: Implement the feed forward part of a neural network from scratch: 2 inputs, 1 hidden layer with 3 nodes, 1 hidden layer with 4 nodes and 1 output node. 

## Assignments in AI Concepts and Algorithms 
This is the second part of the ML class and used the same approach.  
Programming language of choise was Python 3 with libraries to perform machine learning. 

* 01 Convolutional Neural Networks: Use a library of a CNN and compare the results against the library of a fully connected ANN
* 02 Multiple Regression: Compare forward vs. backward selection
* 03 Comparison of Classification using 4 algorithms: Decision Tree vs KNN vs ANN vs Logistic Regression
* 04 DBSCAN: Implement a basic version of DBSCAN and compare it with K-Means
* 05 tSNE vs Principle Component Analysis: Compare tSNE and PCA on a dataset
* 06 Comparison of Classification using 8 algorithms: (all from 03 vs) Support Vector Machine vs Bagged Trees vs Patched Trees vs Random Forests

## Game of Life 
Implement Game of Life both in sequential mode on CPU and multi threaded mode on GPU using OpenMP
